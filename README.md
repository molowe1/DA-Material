Bike Share Data Introduction: This is the Cyclistic bike-share case study! Chicago's Cyclistic bike-share company. The marketing director believes the company's future success depends on increasing annual memberships. So the team wants to know how casual users and annual members use Cyclistic bikes. A new marketing strategy will be designed to convert casual riders into annual members. Until then, your recommendations must be supported by data insights and professional data visualisations.

Characters and Teams: Cyclistic is a bike-sharing programme with over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic distinguishes itself by including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes in its fleet, making bike-share more accessible to people with disabilities and those who can't ride a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders choose traditional bikes, with only about 8% opting for assistive options. Although cyclists are more likely to ride for pleasure, about 30% of them use them to commute to work every day.

Lily Moreno: I'm the marketing director and your boss. Moreno is in charge of promoting the bike-share programme through campaigns and initiatives. Email, social media, and other channels may be used.

Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A group of data analysts tasked with gathering, analysing, and reporting data that aids in the development of Cyclistic marketing strategy. You've been a junior data analyst for six months and have been busy learning about Cyclistic's mission and business goals, as well as how you can help Cyclistic achieve them.

The notoriously detail-oriented executive team of Cyclistic will decide whether or not to approve the recommended marketing programme.

About the company A successful bike-share programme was launched in 2016. The programme now has 5,824 bikes that are geotracked and locked into 692 stations across Chicago. It is possible to unlock the bikes and return them to any other station in the system. Jusqu'à présent, Cyclistic's marketing strategy aimed to raise general awareness and appeal to a broad consumer base. Its flexible pricing plans (single-ride, full-day, and annual memberships) helped make this possible.

Casual riders are those who buy single-ride or full-day passes. Annual membership buyers are Cyclistic members. Annual members are much more profitable than casual riders, say Cyclistic's financial analysts. While Moreno believes that increasing the number of annual members will help Cyclistic grow in the future. Rather than targeting new customers, Moreno believes there is a good chance of converting casual riders into members. She says casual riders already know about and use Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has a specific goal: convert casual riders into annual members. They must first understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why they would buy a membership and how digital media may affect their marketing strategies. Moreno and her team want to look for trends in the Cyclistic historical bike trip data.

The Datasts Selected data for the Dec 2020 to Nov 2021 are provided for the chicago area. All 12 of the data files contain the same core six (12) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776) Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave) End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave) User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them (Chicago, New York City, Washington). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your Python skills more straightforward.

Statistics Computed Analyzed the data related to bike share use in Chicago by computing a variety of descriptive statistics

In this project, written code was used to provide the following information:

Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time): most common month most common day of week most common hour of day

Popular stations and trip: most common start station most common end station most common trip from start to end (i.e. most frequent combination of start station and end station)

Trip duration: total travel time average travel time most travel time minimum travel time maximum travel time

User info: counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
